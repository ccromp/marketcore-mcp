# Errors & Troubleshooting

## Authentication Errors

### 401 Unauthorized

**Cause:** Missing or invalid authentication credentials.

**Solutions:**
- **OAuth:** Reconnect the MCP server in your client settings. Your token may have expired and failed to refresh.
- **API key:** Verify your API key is correct and hasn't been revoked. Check [Integration Settings](https://app.marketcore.ai/integration-settings).
- Ensure you're using the correct URL for your auth method:
  - OAuth: `https://mcp.marketcore.ai`
  - API key (SSE): `https://api.marketcore.ai/x2/mcp/EbZaDl-X/mcp/sse`
  - API key (Streaming): `https://api.marketcore.ai/x2/mcp/EbZaDl-X/mcp/stream`

### 403 Forbidden

**Cause:** Your account doesn't have permission to perform the requested action.

**Solutions:**
- Check your team role — some actions may require owner or admin permissions
- Verify you're on the correct active team
- Private content/collections are only accessible by their creator

## Connection Errors

### Cannot connect to server

**Solutions:**
- Verify the server URL is correct (see above)
- Check your internet connection
- If using an API key, ensure the `Authorization` header format is `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
- Confirm your MCP client supports the transport type you're using (SSE or Streamable HTTP)

### Transport mismatch

**Cause:** Using an SSE URL with a client that expects Streamable HTTP, or vice versa.

**Solutions:**
- OAuth URL (`https://mcp.marketcore.ai`) works with all compatible clients
- For API key connections, try switching between the SSE and Streaming URLs
- Check your client's documentation for which transport it supports

## Tool-Specific Errors

### Invalid UUID / ID not found

**Cause:** Passing an incorrect or stale ID to a tool (e.g., `blueprint_uuid`, `content_id`, `project_id`).

**Solutions:**
- Use the corresponding list tool to get fresh IDs (e.g., `get_blueprints` before `get_blueprint`)
- IDs are UUIDs — ensure you're passing the full string, not a truncated version

### Content generation timeout

**Cause:** Content generation (especially from blueprints) can take 1–3 minutes.

**Solutions:**
- This is normal behavior, not an error. Wait for the response to complete.
- For blueprint-based generation, `create_content` returns a `generation_id` — use `get_generation_status` to poll for completion
- Do not retry the call while a generation is in progress

### Invalid category_id or dimension_option_ids

**Cause:** Using an ID that doesn't exist for your team.

**Solutions:**
- Use `get_content_categories` to get valid category IDs
- Use `get_targeting_dimensions` to get valid dimension option IDs

## Rate Limits

The MarketCore MCP server applies reasonable rate limits to prevent abuse. Under normal usage, you are unlikely to hit these limits. If you receive a rate limit error (HTTP 429), wait a moment before retrying.
