# Overview

MarketCore is a product context management platform that helps go-to-market teams create consistent, on-brand marketing content using AI. It stores your brand context, manages reusable content templates (blueprints), and generates documents informed by your full product knowledge.

The MarketCore MCP Server exposes all of your MarketCore tools directly inside AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT, letting you create blueprints, generate content, manage context, and more — without leaving your AI chat.

## Connection URL

```
https://mcp.marketcore.ai
```

This is the primary URL for connecting to the MarketCore MCP Server. It uses **OAuth authentication**, making it ideal for use with Claude, ChatGPT, and other interactive AI clients.

## Alternative API Key URLs

For MCP clients where supplying an API key directly is simpler than OAuth, use one of these endpoints instead. You can create and manage your MCP API keys in [Integration Settings](https://app.marketcore.ai/integration-settings).

| Transport | URL |
|---|---|
| SSE | `https://api.marketcore.ai/x2/mcp/EbZaDl-X/mcp/sse` |
| Streamable HTTP | `https://api.marketcore.ai/x2/mcp/EbZaDl-X/mcp/stream` |

## Who Is This For?

- **Marketing teams** using AI assistants who want direct access to their MarketCore context and content
- **Developers** building AI-powered workflows that integrate with MarketCore
- **Agencies** managing multiple client accounts through AI tools

## What You Can Do

Through the MCP server, AI clients can:

- **Manage context** — Store and retrieve brand voice, product details, competitive intelligence, and other reference materials
- **Create blueprints** — Build reusable AI content templates with structure, tone, and style guidance
- **Generate content** — Produce marketing documents from scratch or from blueprints, informed by your full product context
- **Organize with projects** — Group related content and context into workstreams
- **Browse the community** — Discover and import blueprint templates shared by other MarketCore users
- **Share and export** — Create public share links and export documents as Word files

## Architecture

The MarketCore MCP Server is a hosted, remote MCP server. There is nothing to install or run locally — your AI client connects directly to MarketCore's server over HTTPS.
